**Welcome to my personal website!**

My name is Jonathan Lys and this is my personal website. I am an engineering student at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en) in France. I am currently doing my final year internship at [Criteo](https://www.criteo.com/), Paris, in the Criteo AI Lab where I am working on diffusion models for image generation.

For a list of my projects, you can check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jonathanlys01), or my portfolio. My latest projects were:
- An academic [project](https://github.com/NewS0ul/FICUS) on the use of [Segment Anything ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643) and [DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14294) to improve a few-shot classification model.
- A web [application](https://github.com/jonathanlys01/DL_2023_CLAP) based on the [CLAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06687) model for text-based sound retrieval and zero-shot sound classification.
- A [project](https://github.com/joanvelja/WrongPose-42028) based on VideoPose3D and Detectron2 to evaluate the quality of a working posture from a video.
